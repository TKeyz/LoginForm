# Login-Form
Here is a login page with a form and instruction that will allow you to play this example. The idea here was to create a page where the user is at the center of attention during the whole process. In term of User-experience, the design has been thought to push you go straight to the point as it's very intuitive and efficient.
The authentification is made in two times, first the user type its email address to trigger a AJAX verification to see if the email matchs with the system, to my case I used PHP but it could be changed by for instance checking into a database, a JSON file or whatever methods you feel comfortable with.
And when the first control is passed, type a password to check again if the logins are right to then get logged in.

Made with pure Javascript, CSS and HTML, this project can be easily implemented to yours if you're familiar with NodeJS and webpacks.
